            DUBAI: Cricket Australia on Thursday revealed that Steve Smith is
            following "concussion protocols" which are crucial for his return to cricket
            in the IPL and asserted that it is "not willing" to compromise with the
            fitness of the Rajasthan Royals skipper.
            CA said it is working in tandem with RR to ensure his smooth return to
            competitive action after missing the entire England ODI series due to the
            concussion suffered during training.
            "Cricket Australia has strict protocols when it comes to head impacts and
            concussions and, as we've seen over the last 12 months, we're not willing
            to compromise on those," CA's head of sports science Alex Kountouris
            said in a statement.
            "Steve is making progress and working with our medical team through the concussion protocols required to return to play," he
            added.

           <p>NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League franchises will be heaving a sigh
            of relief as all the 21 Australian and English players arriving to the UAE
            from the United Kingdom will have to undergo just 36 hours of quarantine
            instead of the earlier prescribed six days.
            All the franchises which have English and Australian players arriving after
            the white ball series in the UK had appealed for reducing the quarantine
            period and the BCCI under Sourav Ganguly's leadership has been able to
            successfully sort the issue out with local authorities in the UAE.
            "Yes, I can confirm that all the English and Australian players have to now
            undergo 36-hour quarantine instead of six days. The matter has been
            sorted and most of the teams will now have their big stars available from the first game itself," a senior IPL functionary privy to
            development told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “Yes, I can confirm that all the English and Australian players have to now undergo 36-hour quarantine instead of six days.

            <p>China’s PLA has installed loudspeakers at the friction points that spew its propaganda on the standoff, accuse New Delhi of escalating tensions to divert from domestic issues and even belt out Punjabi pop numbers.
                The soldiers were part of an eight-nation mission to neutralise China’s Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the last century, an uprising led by young farmers and workers against foreign influence. The British Army had brought in Sikh and Punjab regiments among others.
                The alliance troops moved into Beijing after the Boxer fighters threatened foreigners and kept 400 foreigners holed up in Beijing’s Foreign Legation Quarter. The siege lasted 55 days before 20,000 alliance troops reached Beijing and fought their way in. Nearly 8,000 of them belonged to the British Army from India, many of them Sikh and Punjab regiments. After the victory, according to an account by one Indian sepoy, the British army indulged in looting: French and Russian troops killed civilians and raped women.

        <h2>Tesla Model 3 breaks Guinness World Record as fastest charging electric vehicle</h2>

        <p>Tesla has entered the Guinness Book of Records thanks to its popular Model 3 sedan. During a sponsored run by Zero Carbon World charity, a Tesla Model 3 recorded the fastest charging time for an electric vehicle.

            Formula E racing driver from Mahindra Racing team Alexander Sims, along with Zero Carbon World’s Dean Fielding and EV specialist David Peilow recently took the Tesla Model 3 out on a run in UK to demonstrate improvements in EV charging infrastructure. They targeted to improve the previous record of 3 hours 44 minutes and 33 seconds taken by the previous record-holder in 2015.
            
            Sims and his partners managed to completely thrash the record by spending a little over half an hour charging the vehicle while driving across the country. They trio stopped for just one hour 31 minutes and 32 seconds to replenish the Tesla Model 3 during the record-breaking run. They used a 150kW Tesla Supercharger station and three 350kW Ionity chargers during the 855-mile journey.</p>
