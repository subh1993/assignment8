            <h3>Wahiyat Wednesday: Akshay Kumar's Joker is a cheap mishmash of sci-fi and humour</h3>
            <div class="datep"><div class="date">18 Sep, 2020</div></div>
            <p><i>On August 31, Joker completed eight years of release. This week on Wahiyat Wednesday, we talk about Shirish Kunder's biggest embarrassment till now, Joker.</i></p>
            <img src="akshay.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Long before Joaquin Phoenix won an Oscars for his role of the Joker in the Todd Phillips film, Bollywood had its tryst with their very own, Indianised version of Joker. If you think that we made a film on par with the artistic genius like that of the 2019 film, then let's be clear it stands nowhere in comparison to that. We are talking about Akshay Kumar's Joker, which was released in 2012. In their defence, Bollywood's Joker never actually claimed to have anything to do with DC's coolest villain of all time. Directed by Shirish Kunder, this homegrown Joker boasted of stupidity, poor performances and sheer ignorance of the intellect of the audience.</p>

       <h3>Amid India-China standoff, Lhasa city’s air raid drill raises eyebrows</h3>
       <p><i>China has been holding air raid drills in major cities in September to mark the annual National Defense Education Day. However, the timing of this drill has raised many eyebrows as the last time such exercise was carried out in Lhasa was in 2009.</i></p>

       <p>Amid growing tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control, Chinese state-run media has reported that the government of Lhasa city, the administrative capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, will conduct an air raid drill on September 19.

        China has been holding air raid drills in major cities in September to mark the annual National Defense Education Day. However, the timing of this drill has raised many eyebrows as the last time such exercise was carried out in Lhasa was in 2009.
        
        In the current situation of ongoing border friction between China and India, this looks like Beijing’s psychological warfare tactic to create a climate of fear among local Tibetans.
        
        The formal statement about the air defence alarm drill was carried by all local media and many Weibo handles.
        
        The Chinese government in Lhasa city said that the siren will be played on September 19 in three different types. The first will be played for three minutes from 12 to 12.03pm sounding for 36 seconds with a gap of 24 seconds.
        
        The second one will be run for three minutes from 12.06 to 12.09pm sounding for six seconds with a gap of six seconds. The third alarm will be broadcast for three minutes from 12:12 to 12:15pm for the complete duration without any gap.
        
        In a special announcement dated September 14, the Lhasa city government said the test will “improve the general public’s conception of national defense and civil air defense awareness” However, no specific explanation for the three types of alarms was provided in the media or in the announcement.</p>
